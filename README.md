# BHousePricePredictor
Everyone wants to live in a nice place. The price of houses are dependent on a large number of factors such as area, number of rooms, location, crime rate. This project predicts the price of a house given the dependent factors. The project compares the accuracy of the prediction using machine learning algorithms: decision trees and random forest techniques.
